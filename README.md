dramadive-server
================

This is the web server component of the Drama Dive project, that recieves POSTs from the client (and Dream Cheeky Big Red Button) and gives a certain amount of money to charity via the PayPal API each day depending on the configuration of the server.

For the client see https://github.com/1stvamp/dramadive-client
